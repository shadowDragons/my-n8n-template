Description
This comprehensive n8n automation template orchestrates a complete end-to-end workflow for generating engaging short-form Point-of-View (POV) style videos using multiple AI services and automatically publishing them across major social media platforms. It takes ideas from a Google Sheet and transforms them into finished videos with captions, voiceovers, and platform-specific descriptions, ready for distribution.

Who Is This For?
Content Creators & Agencies: Mass-produce unique short-form video content for various clients or channels with minimal manual effort.
Digital Marketers: Automate video content pipelines to boost online presence and engagement across multiple platforms simultaneously.
Social Media Managers: Schedule and distribute consistent video content efficiently without juggling multiple tools and manual uploads.
Businesses: Leverage AI to create branded video content for marketing, reducing production time and costs.
What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?
Creating and distributing high-quality short-form video content consistently across multiple social networks is incredibly time-consuming and resource-intensive. This workflow tackles these challenges by:

Automating Idea-to-Video Pipeline: Generates video concepts, image prompts, scripts, images, video clips, and voiceovers using AI.
Streamlining Video Assembly: Automatically combines generated assets into a final video using a template.
Generating Platform-Optimized Descriptions: Creates relevant descriptions for posts by transcribing the final video audio.
Automating Multi-Platform Publishing: Uploads the final video and description to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn simultaneously.
Reducing Manual Workload: Drastically cuts down the time and effort required for video production and distribution.
Centralized Tracking: Updates a Google Sheet with results, costs, and status for easy monitoring.
How It Works
Trigger & Input: Runs on a daily schedule (configurable) and fetches new video ideas from a designated Google Sheet.
AI Content Generation:
Uses OpenAI to generate video captions and image prompts based on the idea.
Uses PiAPI (Flux) to generate images from prompts.
Uses PiAPI (Kling) to generate video clips from the images (Image-to-Video).
Uses OpenAI to generate a voiceover script based on the captions.
Uses ElevenLabs to generate voiceover audio from the script and uploads it to Google Drive.
Video Assembly: Combines the generated video clips, captions, and voiceover audio using a Creatomate template to render the final video.
Description Generation: Uploads the final video to Google Drive, extracts the audio using OpenAI (Whisper), and generates a social media description using OpenAI (GPT).
Multi-Platform Distribution: Uses upload-post.com to upload the final video and generated description to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
Tracking & Notification: Updates the original Google Sheet row with output details (video link, costs, tokens used) and sends a completion notification via Discord.
