Who is this template for?
This workflow template is designed for any professionals seeking relevent data from database using natural language.

How it works
Each time user ask's question using the n8n chat interface, the workflow runs.
Then the message is processed by AI Agent using relevent tools - Execute SQL Query, Get DB Schema and Tables List and Get Table Definition, if required. Agent uses these tool to form and run sql query which are necessary to answer the questions.
Once AI Agent has the data, it uses it to form answer and returns it to the user.
Set up instructions
Complete the Set up credentials step when you first open the workflow. You'll need a Postgresql Credentials, and OpenAI api key.
